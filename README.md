# dielectric_estimation_ml

dp_ml (dielectric property estimation using machine learning) is an open source package for estimating dielectric properties of biological tissues from antenna measurements. 
It uses simulations of materials with known properties to generate models which can predict properties from future measurements. 
This work is performed in the research group of Dr. Elise Fear at the University of Calgary.
